Debugging Note: If you would like to jump straight ahead to the game, go ahead and change the
starting scene to world.tscn. To do this, go to Project > Project Settings >
General > Application > Run > Main Scene. Click the file open icon to the right
of the scene listed to open a file. Select world.tscn so you can start there
instead of at the main menu. Do not forget to switch back to title_screen.tscn once you are done.
